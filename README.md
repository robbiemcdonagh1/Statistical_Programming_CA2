This README file is to provide a breif explaination of the code provided in a little more deatil than the comments in the code provides. Initially we are required to import the necessary libraries to help all of our code run smoothly.

After that I imported the CSV files using tibble. I did this so that we can join our files together. The paths for csv files are unique to the user as every computer usesa different path with different names so be cautious of this.
